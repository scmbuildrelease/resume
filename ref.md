 I am writing to highly recommend Iris for the position of Software Build and Release Engineer. Having been a close associate of hers for many years, I have observed her accumulate over 15 years of experience in this field, making her an exceptionally qualified candidate.

Iris has a specialized skill set in developing and optimizing CI/CD systems and processes, ensuring they function with maximum efficiency and reliability. Her ability to quickly adapt to and enhance existing CI/CD systems is complemented by her adept management of daily build tagging, snapshotting, branching jobs, and weekly software rollouts.

She established the first Jenkins/Nexus/Perforce CI/CD build system for VUDUâ€™s iOS and Android projects. Following the creation of Jenkins/Docker/Mesos cloud-based build systems, she developed Jenkins/Docker/AWS cloud-based systems in response to the NBCUniversal acquisition. Iris also managed the migration and creation of Jenkins jobs across various platforms, including physical machines, VMs, Mesos cloud environments, and AWS cloud environments. By automating Jenkins job creation using Groovy scripts and Jenkinsfiles, she facilitated efficient tracking and maintenance of change history, enhancing overall efficiency and quality.

In her role, Iris also serves as the administrator for Jenkins, Git Swarm, Git Fusion, Bitbucket, Perforce, Buildbot, Nexus repository, Docker repository, and the Mesos build system. Her expertise extends to successfully managing version control tool setups and migrations, including migrating source code with change history from Perforce to GitLab and from GitLab to Bitbucket.

As a staff build and release engineer, Iris coordinated with Development, Operations, and SQA teams to drive improvements in CI/CD tools and processes. She provided training and ongoing technical support, developed documentation, conducted PR reviews, managed permissions, tracked issues in Jira, created Slack channels, and integrated Slack and Jira with the Jenkins automated build process. These efforts ensured the CI/CD process was well-defined, manageable, and effectively tracked.

To enhance software development team code quality, Iris implemented Jenkins integration solutions for Veracode source code security scans. This allowed engineers to benefit from real-time code scan results, promptly receive security scores, and identify code-related security issues along with recommendations for remediation.

Iris also made significant contributions to the SQA automation team by integrating test jobs with Jenkins. This integration enabled automated test scripts to run on Jenkins post-build, with test cases assessing newly deployed software in AWS Docker containers and delivering results to Jenkins and Slack channels promptly.

Additionally, Iris collaborated with the Ops team to integrate Puppet with Jenkins jobs, facilitating automated deployments to integration/SQA environments after build and test jobs.

She provided mentoring and training for three new CI/CD team members, ensuring their swift adaptation to daily tasks. Iris designed and implemented a comprehensive new hire training structure covering the release process, Gitswarm, Jenkins, Buildbot, and Perforce. She provided detailed technical documentation and continuously reviewed and enhanced the training classes. Furthermore, Iris meticulously documented typical build issues and Git/Jenkins technical skills, ensuring effective knowledge transfer to other engineers.

As a certified PMP, Iris collaborates closely with the PMO team and plays a crucial role in the software development process review project team. She supplies detailed evidence, including documentation, software tools, change histories, and presentations with screenshots, to the review team. Her contributions have been essential in ensuring the company successfully passes ISO 9000 and SEI-CMM reviews and assessments.

Iris's extensive experience and versatile skill set make her an outstanding candidate for this role. I am confident she will be a valuable addition to your team.
