I am writing to highly recommend Iris for the position of Software Build and Release Engineer. Having worked closely with her for many years, I have seen her accumulate over 15 years of experience in this field, making her an exceptionally qualified candidate.

Iris has a specialized skill set in developing and optimizing CI/CD systems, ensuring they function with maximum efficiency and reliability. Her ability to adapt quickly and enhance existing CI/CD systems is complemented by her adept management of daily build tagging, snapshotting, branching jobs, and weekly software rollouts.

She established the first Jenkins/Nexus/Perforce CI/CD build system for VUDUâ€™s iOS and Android projects. Following this, she developed Jenkins/Docker/AWS cloud-based systems in response to the NBCUniversal acquisition, and managed the migration and creation of Jenkins jobs across various platforms, including physical machines, VMs, Mesos cloud environments, and AWS. Iris automated Jenkins job creation using Groovy scripts and Jenkinsfiles, which facilitated efficient tracking and maintenance of change history, thereby enhancing overall efficiency and quality.

In her role, Iris also serves as the administrator for Jenkins, Git Swarm, Git Fusion, Bitbucket, Perforce, Buildbot, Nexus repository, Docker repository, and the Mesos build system. Her expertise extends to managing version control tool setups and migrations, including the migration of source code from Perforce to GitLab and from GitLab to Bitbucket.

As a staff build and release engineer, Iris coordinated with Development, Operations, and SQA teams to drive improvements in CI/CD tools and processes. She provided training, ongoing technical support, developed documentation, conducted PR reviews, managed permissions, tracked issues in Jira, created Slack channels, and integrated Slack and Jira with the Jenkins build process. These efforts ensured the CI/CD process was well-defined, manageable, and effectively tracked.

To enhance software development code quality, Iris implemented Jenkins integration solutions for Veracode source code security scans. This allowed engineers to benefit from real-time code scan results, receive prompt security scores, and identify code-related security issues along with remediation recommendations.

Iris also contributed significantly to the SQA automation team by integrating test jobs with Jenkins, enabling automated test scripts to run post-build. This integration allowed test cases to assess newly deployed software in AWS Docker containers and deliver results to Jenkins and Slack channels promptly.

Additionally, Iris collaborated with the Ops team to integrate Puppet with Jenkins jobs, facilitating automated deployments to integration/SQA environments after build and test jobs.

She provided mentoring and training for three new CI/CD team members, ensuring their swift adaptation to daily tasks. Iris designed a comprehensive new hire training structure covering the release process, Gitswarm, Jenkins, Buildbot, and Perforce. She provided detailed technical documentation, continuously reviewed and improved the training classes, and meticulously documented typical build issues and Git/Jenkins technical skills to ensure effective knowledge transfer.

As a certified PMP, Iris collaborates closely with the PMO team and plays a crucial role in the software development process review project team. She supplies detailed evidence, including documentation, software tools, change histories, and presentations, to support the review team. Her contributions have been essential in ensuring successful ISO 9000 and SEI-CMM reviews and assessments.

Iris's extensive experience and versatile skill set make her an outstanding candidate for this role. I am confident she will be a valuable addition to your team.
